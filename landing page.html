				The beautiful city of Perugia, Italy is under the control of the Italian Mafia.<br>
				You and your partner, as agents of the Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia), have been assigned the task of 
				discinerating the mafia from within its command. You both have somehow found a way into the Mafia gang.
				But, the Mafia boss has been informed that there are 2 agents amongst the present gang members.
				Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to destroy the Mafia from within whilst using your wit and convincing powers to stay alive.
